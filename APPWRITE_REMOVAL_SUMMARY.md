# Appwrite Removal Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

### Files Deleted
- **`src/cloud/appwrite_retrieval.py`** - Main Appwrite integration module (354 lines)

### Files Updated

#### 1. **Backend Server** (`backend/backend_server.py`)
- ‚úÖ Already cleaned (no Appwrite imports)
- Status: No changes needed - already using Cloudinary + Pinecone

#### 2. **Configuration Template** (`.env.template`)
- ‚ùå Removed: All APPWRITE_* environment variables
  - `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`
  - `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`
  - `APPWRITE_API_KEY`
  - `APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID`
  - `APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID`
  - `APPWRITE_BUCKET_HEALTHCARE`
  - `APPWRITE_BUCKET_SATELLITE`
  - `APPWRITE_BUCKET_SURVEILLANCE`
- ‚úÖ Added: Updated values for FEATURE_DIMENSION (8 ‚Üí 2048)

#### 3. **Frontend Environment** (`frontend/.env.example`)
- ‚ùå Removed: `VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` and `VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`
- ‚úÖ Added: `VITE_API_TIMEOUT` configuration

#### 4. **Frontend App Component** (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Updated footer: "Powered by AE-QIP Algorithm & Appwrite" ‚Üí "Powered by Quantum Algorithm & Cloudinary + Pinecone"

#### 5. **Frontend Types** (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Updated `HealthResponse` interface
  - ‚ùå Removed: `appwrite: string`
  - ‚úÖ Added: `storage: string` (for Cloudinary)
  - ‚úÖ Added: `vectors: string` (for Pinecone)

#### 6. **Healthcare Uploader** (`healthcare_uploader.py`)
- ‚úÖ Updated imports: Appwrite ‚Üí Cloudinary + Pinecone
- ‚úÖ Refactored to use:
  - `CloudinaryImageService` for image storage
  - `PineconeVectorService` for vector storage
- ‚úÖ Updated docstring: "Appwrite" ‚Üí "Cloudinary and stores vectors in Pinecone"

#### 7. **Database Check Script** (`scripts/utils/check_db.py`)
- ‚úÖ Updated to query Pinecone statistics
- ‚úÖ Removed Appwrite database calls

## üìã Remaining Appwrite References (Scripts Only)

The following script files still contain Appwrite references. These are utility/batch scripts that can be updated on-demand:

### Scripts Directory (`scripts/upload/`)
- `upload_healthcare.py` - Healthcare image batch upload
- `upload_satellite.py` - Satellite image batch upload
- `upload_surveillance.py` - Surveillance image batch upload
- `upload_testing_images.py` - Testing data upload
- `upload_all.py` - Batch uploader coordinator

### Maintenance Scripts (`scripts/maintenance/`)
- `update_collection_512d.py` - Database schema migration (Appwrite-specific)

**Note:** These scripts are for batch operations and testing only. The main application (`backend_server.py`) is fully cleaned and uses Cloudinary + Pinecone.

## üîÑ Migration Path

If you need these scripts updated later:

1. **Healthcare Images** - Use `healthcare_uploader.py` (already updated)
2. **Satellite Images** - Update `scripts/upload/upload_satellite.py`
3. **Surveillance Images** - Update `scripts/upload/upload_surveillance.py`
4. **Test Images** - Update `scripts/upload/upload_testing_images.py`

## üéØ Current Architecture

### Storage Layer
- **Image Storage**: ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudinary (via `services/cloudinary_service.py`)
- **Vector Storage**: üìä Pinecone (via `services/pinecone_service.py`)

### Configuration
- **Backend**: Uses `config.py` with Cloudinary + Pinecone env vars
- **Frontend**: Uses `VITE_API_URL` to connect to backend

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_value
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_value
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_value

# Pinecone
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_value
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=quantum-images-prod

# Server
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
```

## ‚ú® Key Changes Summary

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Image Storage | Appwrite Storage | ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudinary |
| Vector DB | Appwrite Database | üìä Pinecone |
| Feature Dimension | 8D | 2048D (configurable) |
| Main Backend | ‚úÖ Already clean | ‚úÖ Ready for production |
| Frontend UI | "Appwrite" | "Cloudinary + Pinecone" |

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Main application is fully cleaned and ready
2. ‚è≥ (Optional) Update batch scripts if needed for bulk operations
3. ‚úÖ Docker setup supports both services automatically
4. ‚úÖ Deploy with confidence using the new stack
